# develenv_dmriprep_docker
a dockerfile that builds the devel env for dmriprep

This is what I use to build a dmriprep devel env on a local computer

To make this work for you..

1. clone this repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/edickie/develenv_dmriprep_docker.git
```

1. (a) ... if running for the first time change open the Dockerfile and change the git clone statement to point to your own fork for dmriprep..

2. Now open up powershell and run the dockerfile

If you want some data (beyond that already in the tests) to work with then you should make a folder somewhere and mount it into the docker as you run it.

```sh


```
